<h2>Reflections:</h2>
I have gained so many useful input especially to create as early as possible Linkedin account’s to put on interesting activities that I have joined or achievement that I gained during studies.He also shared on useful activities that we can join as first or second year student to enhance and boost our CV’s input quality.As far as I know,we do not
need to be active on all colloge or faculty’s activities but we must choose the one that are related to our study scope area (for example:coding competiotion and database workshop)

<h2>Reflections:</h2>
The most highlighted information that I get is“ what is the criteria that I must have to increase my employability rate.
-Communication,teamwork and problem solving is the main skills that I am looking for to improve in myself in order for me to be a quality graduate.
-Be able to communicate,present and work in English language is my main concern for now as they mentioned PPG’s company are worldwide company

<h2>Reflections:</h2>
From the talk given by Mr. Ninderjit Singh, we got to know about the infrastructure services that Petronas has and we also had learned about how Petronas utilize their
technologies in order to communicate with the other branch or client throughout the world. Not only that, they also have a cybersecurity team in each department which control the
access of their respective data and protect it from the outsiders. On the other hand, Mr. Roman provided us with the skills that are crucial and required in Software Engineering field such as analytical thinking and problem-solving skills as well as programming skills. He also gave us the information about what kind of software and technologies that the softwarE engineers of Petronas use in their daily task to manage their data and systems.

<h2>Reflections:</h2>
From this visit, we had gained the knowledge about Huawei’s technologies and how it functions in real world. It is not only help the community to live their lives more efficiently, but it also contribute in education with the invention of smart boards. This board can help the lecturers to teach the students easily by not using any physical tools or books. So, both the lecturers and students can access their study materials virtually without bringing any laptops or books to the classes.

<h2>Reflections:</h2>
Reflections:I dream of myself becoming a system developer in the next four years, but only if I take seriously how to improve my academic record and technical proficiency, as well as my soft skills, which will make an employer want to recruit me. I need to get proficient in C++ and  MySQL among other software to make my work as a system developer easier. Additionally, the secret to success is consistency and being passionate about what I do.

<h2>Reflections:</h2>
Reflections:I also acquire a lot of useful knowledge while working on this tool as I go deeper into the database's backend while also developing our critical thinking in order to generate a proper semi-functional solution. To summarize, during the process of developing the Power BM tools,we as a team undoubtedly discovered numerous life lessons that will undoubtedly improve our style of thinking as well as our interactions with one another in order to form a compact
teamwork. We learned to work more efficiently and effectively under time constraints while also prioritizing quality.As a video editor, editing and recording the entire process of our Power BM tool creation journey have been amazing journey.I hope that this Power BM tool can be created when I have enough knowledge to create this system that can ease users who are struggling in managing databases.My goals towards the project is to minimize the error are made by AI until human can rely on them without doubtful.

<h2>Reflections</h2>

-I learned new skills and knowledge from the PC assembly lab, including how to correctly assemble and disassemble a PC while being assisted by a skilled lab assistant.Before this, I would often ask for instructions on how to assemble a PC because I lacked knowledge and direction.Fortunately, the PC that my group (Group 1) assembled and disassembled lit up, demonstrating our newly acquired PC assembly skills.Afterwards , in order to assess our knowledge from the lab session, we must complete a brief exam on PC assembly.I am pleased with myself since I was able to obtain 5.5 out of 6 points.


<b> Suggestion for improvement </b>

- The PC components should be upgraded or replaced because it seems old and might be damaged in the future
