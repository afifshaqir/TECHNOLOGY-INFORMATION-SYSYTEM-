Reflections:I dream of myself becoming a system developer in the next four years, but only if I take seriously how to improve my academic record and technical proficiency, as well as my soft skills, which will make an employer want to recruit me. I need to get proficient in C++ and  MySQL among other software to make my work as a system developer easier. Additionally, the secret to success is consistency and being passionate about what I do.

<h2>Reflections</h2>

<b> What do I get ? </b>

-I learned new skills and knowledge from the PC assembly lab, including how to correctly assemble and disassemble a PC while being assisted by a skilled lab assistant.Before this, I would often ask for instructions on how to assemble a PC because I lacked knowledge and direction.Fortunately, the PC that my group (Group 1) assembled and disassembled lit up, demonstrating our newly acquired PC assembly skills.Afterwards , in order to assess our knowledge from the lab session, we must complete a brief exam on PC assembly.I am pleased with myself since I was able to obtain 5.5 out of 6 points.


<b> Suggestion for improvement </b>

- The PC components should be upgraded or replaced because it seems old and might be damaged in the future
